    <h1 class="blog-heading">My Work With InstantPost</h1>
    <p>
      Iâ€™ve been part of
      <a target="_blank" href="https://instantpost.in">Instantpost</a> since August 2018 as a work from home Intern.
    </p>
    <p>Even though I was working from home it didn't mean there was less work or something like that. I struggled a lot at the beginning, I was in my 2nd year of college what do you expect?.</p>
    <p>
      I had no prior experience with any of the work required,
      <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/i01000001/">my mentor</a> who is also the founder of InstantPost have always kept his cool, trusting me and my work their. My experience have been fruitful as I've come across many a things which changed the way I think about Tech
    </p>
    <p>My journey could have ended in January 2019 but I was given this amazing opportunity to extend my stay for another 6 months that is still continuing at the time of writing this post.</p>
